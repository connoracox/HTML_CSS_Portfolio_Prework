                    The Pacific Crest Trail is a long-distance National Scenic Trail that goes from Mexico 
                    to Canada through California, Oregon, and Washington. It is 2,650 miles in length and 
                    takes an average of 3-6 months to complete. Over a 5 month period, I thru-hiked the 
                    Pacific Crest Trail from April to September of 2017. It was one of the most fun 
                    and most challenging experiences of my life.

                    The Continental Divide Trail is another one of America's National Scenic Trails. 
                    Like the PCT, it also goes border-to-border from Mexico to Canada through 
                    New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. The CDT is roughly 3,000 miles 
                    long and takes an average of 4-6 months to complete. Due to it's intense weather,
                    high elevation, and number of miles, it is often considered to be the hardest of 
                    the main thru-hikes in the US. I completed it in 4 and a half months in 2022.
